I'll refactor the code to separate concerns into multiple files with a proper project structure.Now let me create the updated project structure and setup guide:Perfect! I've refactored the Flask API into a clean, modular structure with proper separation of concerns. Here's what I've organized:

## **Architecture Layers:**

1. **Models Layer** (`models/`) - Database operations and ORM
2. **Service Layer** (`services/`) - Business logic and validation
3. **Controller Layer** (`routes/`) - API endpoints and HTTP handling
4. **Schema Layer** (`schemas/`) - API documentation and validation
5. **Configuration** (`config.py`) - Environment and database settings

## **Key Benefits:**

- **Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without touching existing code
- **Reusability**: Services can be reused across different controllers
- **Clean Code**: Clear separation makes the codebase easier to understand

## **File Responsibilities:**

- `app.py` - Application factory and main entry point
- `models/user.py` - Database model with CRUD methods
- `services/user_service.py` - Business logic and validation
- `routes/user_routes.py` - REST API endpoints
- `schemas/user_schemas.py` - Swagger documentation models
- `config.py` - Configuration management

This structure follows industry best practices and makes it much easier to maintain, test, and extend your API. The service layer acts as a bridge between your controllers and models, handling all business logic and validation in one place.
